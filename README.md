# CS 3330 â€“ Computer Architecture

Course Content:

    How computers are built and how that impacts you as a programmer.
    How to make code run quickly, or at least how to avoid making it run slowly.
    A reasonable amount of C, a moderate amount of x86 assembly, and a little of a hardware description language called HCL.
    How hardware guesses what your code will do before it does it.
    More than you knew there was to know about memory and caching.
