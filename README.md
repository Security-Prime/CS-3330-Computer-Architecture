# CS 3330 â€“ Computer Architecture

Heavily based on Linux. 
Implemented HCLRS from scratch which is an implementation of an educational hardware description language interpreter. It was a confusing assignment but it was really cool to create CPU features such as pipe lining and forwarding any process. It was really hard to get used to but overall it was a cool assignment.  The rest of the assignments were related to optimizing and reducing the runtime of our functions using a different structure (array vs linked list) or process (parallel vs series). 


Course Content:

    How computers are built and how that impacts you as a programmer.
    How to make code run quickly, or at least how to avoid making it run slowly.
    A reasonable amount of C, a moderate amount of x86 assembly, and a little of a hardware description language called HCL.
    How hardware guesses what your code will do before it does it.
    More than you knew there was to know about memory and caching.
